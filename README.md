# Custom 16-bit RISC CPU

The goal for this project is to create a custom 16-bit RISC CPU. 
The specifications are yet to be done, but the rough outline for the project will be:
1. Research and specification design
2. Make an emulator for the architecture
3. Make an assembler for the architecture
4. Create a circuit in a logic simulator
5. (Create a schematic for assembly)
6. (Order and assemble the processor)
