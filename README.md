# TDP-11

The goal for this project is to create a custom 16-bit CPU. You can find the design specs in [design.md](design.md).

Here is a rough roadmap for the project:
- [x] Research and design specification 
- [x] Make an emulator for the architecture
- [x] Make an assembler for the architecture
- [ ] Program the design into an FPGA
- [ ] (Create a schematic for assembly)
- [ ] (Order and assemble the processor)
